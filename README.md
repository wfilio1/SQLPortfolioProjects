# covid19data
Using COVID-19 data sourced from "ourworldindata.org," I conducted an analysis of the data from 2020-2023 and 
utilized SQL queries to explore and analyze the data sets. I've calculated death percentages and infection rates from various countries and continents.
I've used Tableau (public) to visualize trends and patterns using charts ang graphs, which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wendy.filio/viz/CovidDashboard2020-2023_16957558138390/Dashboard2#1
